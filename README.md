# MinecraftAimTrainerReleases
Mod is made for 1.8.9 forge (hopefully works for all new versions)

Download the MouseDelayFix mod, and pick a version above (newest probably best) and download the mod file and the example scenarios if you want.
 
Play in a creative world (cheats on to be safe) that you aren't afraid of damaging.
 
Once the game has launched, saved scenarios can be found at your minecraft folder (same one as where your mods are located) -> Pillow Aim Trainer -> Saves
 
Under each version folder, you can find some example scenarios and they can be put inside the "Saves" folder.
 
After running "/refresh" in game, you can load the scenarios by typing "/loadscenario <name>".
 
For example, a scenario called "Gridshot - caterpillow.json" can be played with "/loadscenario Gridshot".
 
To create your own scenarios, you can refer to the video: https://youtu.be/qAx5DSNi6MA
 
Have fun!
